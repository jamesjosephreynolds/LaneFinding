# Project 1 - Lane Finding
The goal of this project is to implement a lane finder on road images.  There are some limitations, such as assuming lanes are always straight.  Refer to AdvLaneFinding repository for an improved lane finder project.

The project pipeline is implemented as Jupyter notebook. The project is instructor guided, with goals and milestones defined in the template notebook.
